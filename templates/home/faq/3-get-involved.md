## if you're interested in getting involved with the DAO, there are a few ways you can do so:

### by supporting mferish public goods

the DAO is designed to support mferish public goods projects, so you can also show your support by contributing to these projects directly.

This could involve providing resources or volunteering your time and skills. Come join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and introduce yourself! We love meeting new builders.

### by participating in an onchain auction

the **$MFBLDR** tokens are distributed through an auction every 69 minutes, with 100% of the auction sales going to the DAO treasury.

As a **$MFBLDR** token holder, you will have the ability to propose and vote on actions to be taken with the treasury.

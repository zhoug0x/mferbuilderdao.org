order: 4

## Ideas are everything. Ideas are the product of humans being creative. Some ideas even have the potential to turn into _dope shit_.

The mferbuilderDAO turns **ideas** into **dope shit** via **onchain proposals**.

In order to maximize the chance of creating dope shit, ideas can go through the following stages:

1. the **chaos** of [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and Twitter (idea factory)
2. an **offchain** proposal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mferbuilderdao.eth) (heat check)
3. an **onchain** proposal to the [DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/0x795D300855069F602862c5e23814Bdeeb25DCa6b) (the real deal)

Please keep in mind that the DAO is still very new, and is in a constant state of evolution. Pop into the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pteFhXpCrw) and say hello if you have any ideas, questions or comments!

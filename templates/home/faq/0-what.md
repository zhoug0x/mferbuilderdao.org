title: what is mferbuilderDAO?
order: 0
---

## _mferbuilderDAO_ is a _[hyperstructure](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html)_ with the mission to _support mferish builders_ working on _mferish public goods_.

_**ok mfer, wtf does that even mean?**_

- The mferbuilderDAO is a **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)** designed to support builders who, through their work and love for mfers, support the mfers and CC0/FOSS ecosystem.
- The DAO is backed by a [Nounish](https://nouns.build) governance framework with an onchain auction that occurs **every 69 minutes**, with 100% of the proceeds going to the [mferbuilderDAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6D538Bab6E961dD9719Bd6f9676293989CA8D714).
- The auctions run indefinitely without intervention, and mint [$MFBLDR tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0x795D300855069F602862c5e23814Bdeeb25DCa6b) - a generative series of ERC721s created from the OG mfers layers.

The mferbuilderDAO is governed by the **$MFBLDR** token owners, who can use their tokens to create offchain/onchain proposals and vote on actions to be taken in the DAO, such as funding a new mobile app, or evolving the artwork by voting in new layers.

## The mfers are a diverse group of people with a wide range of skills, experience and resources. 

However, without a decentralized infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and coordination, it is difficult for mfers to work together effectively on large-scale projects that don't necessarily have a measurable ROI.

By leveraging the blockchain, the mferbuilderDAO creates a **transparent and democratic process** for decision-making within the mfer builder community for providing support, funding and resources to the _"mferish public goods"_.

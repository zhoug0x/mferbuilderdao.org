## let's start by defining "mferish:

**mferish** is a term to describe something that adheres to the _core principles_ of the mfers and mferish culture.

**mferish core principles:**

- _mfers jus gettin started_
- _mfers do what they want, as long as it doesnâ€™t hurt other mfers_
- _we all mfers_

To learn about mfers and the mfers value system, check out the article [what are mfers](https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth/QukjtL1076-1SEoNJuqyc-x4Ut2v8_TocKkszo-S_nU) authored by [sartoshi](https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth), the mfers creator.

## what's a public good?

In the context of mferbuilderDAO, we define a **public good** as a **product** that is **non-excludable** and **non-rivalrous.**

**non-excludable:**

- it is not possible to exclude someone from consuming the product

**non-rivalrous:**

- consumption of the product by one individual does not reduce the availability of the product for others

Some real-world examples of public goods are things like clean air, Wikipedia, public water fountains and national security. These products are very useful, but can be difficult for private ventures to provide efficiently due to their unique economic characteristics, sometimes causing them to fall victim to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

## so, what's an _mferish_ public good then?

An mferish public good is an action, project, or a way of thinking that promotes optimism, freedom and inclusion within the mfer and CC0/FOSS community, and as a result, creates a positive-sum environment for mfers to collaborate, coordinate, build, and vibe.

In short, it's **something open and free for mfers to use, so they can continue doing what they want.** No strings attached.

Thankfully, today in the digital realm we are backed-up by blockchain technology. We have the tools to fund these open products and initiatives - so let's give it a shot!
